gini_explanation=  These charts show <em>Lorenz Curves</em>: the population ranked from poorest to richest on the x-axis, and the share of income of the population up to that point on the y-axis. If the distribution is perfectly equal, the curves would be a 45 degree straight line. The <em>Gini Coefficient</em> is a summary measure of the Lorenz curve; perfect equality produces a Gini of 0, complete inequality produces a Gini of 100.
