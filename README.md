Wales Social Care Simulation
============================

In conjunction with [Landman Economics]('http://www.landman-economics.co.uk/)
we've just completed a major piece of work for the Welsh Assembly
Government('http://wales.gov.uk') on modelling the finance of social care.
        
This is the most technically sophisticated model we've ever been involved in;
indeed, we believe it to be one of the most complex microsimulation projects
ever undertaken anwhere in the world. It uses [British Household Panel Survey]
(https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/bhps) (BHPS) data to model demand for social care
under many possible financing systems for up to 20 years. The projects are made
either by ageing the households - increasing the ages of household members and
applying estimated probabilities of major events such as retirement, worsening
of health and eventually death, or by [selectively reweighing the households to
match population projects projections]
(http://www.economics.unimelb.edu.au/downloads/wpapers-05/935.pdf).
